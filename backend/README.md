## Running

Create a `.env` file in this directory using the `.env.template` file as reference and add your own [Twilio keys](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/javascript-v2-getting-started#2-get-an-api-key). After that, you can start this server by running the following commands:

```bash
# install project dependencies (first time only)
pipenv install

# run the server
./bootstrap.sh
```
