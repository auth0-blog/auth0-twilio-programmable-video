# Twilio Programmable Video Secured with Auth0

This sample consists of two subprojects:

1. A frontend React app which users can use to join video conferences supported by Twilio.
2. A backend API, built with Python/Flask, that generates Twilio tokens that the frontend app needs to join conferences.

Both the frontend React app and the backend API are secured with Auth0. 

## Running

To run this sample, check both [the `README.md` file on the `backend` directory](./backend/) and the [`README.md` file on the `frontend` directory](./frontend/). Just make sure you have both subprojects up and running before trying to join a conference.
